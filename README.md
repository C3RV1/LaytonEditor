# Layton Editor

Rom editor for a professor layton romhack. Created by Team Top Hat.
The instructions on how to use the editor are on the `wiki` page.

Japanese is not yet supported.

Current support is limited to Professor Layton 2. Other games have not been
tested, but would probably lack many features and give many errors.

## Installation

To install the LaytonEditor just clone this repository and install the
dependencies listed on `requirements.txt`.

To run just execute `python laytonEditor.py`.
