# Layton Editor

Rom editor for a professor layton romhack. Created by Team Top Hat.
The instructions on how to use the editor are on the `wiki` page. You can also find there the installation instructions on the *Home* page.

Japanese is not yet supported.

Current support is limited to Professor Layton 2. Other games have not been
tested, but would probably lack many features, and stability is not guaranteed.
