Schrader "" "" 2 voice 410: This nickname would appear to be
    well deserved, since it is rumoured
    to kill whoever opens it.@p@c
    I'm dubious of this reputation, of
    course, but when my interest is
    piqued I simply must investigate.@p@c
    That's why I'm pleased as punch to
    tell you that the elusive item is
    finally in my possession.@p@c
    What's more, I believe I'm on the
    cusp of unravelling a great
    mystery tied to this box.@p@c
    For the moment, let's just say I
    have a theory, though I haven't
    been able to prove it yet.

Schrader "" "" 2 voice 411: Initially, it was my intention to

    to open its lid.@p@c
    But I must confess that my
    curiosity is simply overpowering.@p@c
    In the unlikely event that anything
    should happen to me, please finish
    the work I've started here.@p@c
    Your friend,
    Andrew Schrader

Layton "b4 normal" "" 2 voice 17: According to the postmark, this
    letter was sent two days ago. We
    should go pay the doctor a visit.@p@c
    I just can't shake the feeling that
    something awful has happened...
Luke "b1 smile" "" 3 voice 18: Well, your intuition's usually

    reach out and touch it.
